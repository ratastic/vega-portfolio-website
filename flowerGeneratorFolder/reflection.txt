What have you discovered about the form you've chosen through this assignment?

  The essence of an object can oftentimes be very easily conveyed through the sole use of primitive shapes; for example, the essence of a flower. A flower can be broken down into just a bunch of ellipses, which is the main shape I used in constructing my random flower generator. And though the flowers that are generated by my machine don't look like the flowers you'd see on the street or in a garden, they still look like flowers, only simplified. Because of this I added pistil details and a leaf growing from the stem to better capture the form of the flower. 

I wanted my generator to produce more visually interesting flowers rather than just having circles with protruding ellipses. So, I added layered petals and pistils coming out of the seed center to emulate the appearance of an anemone flower. I sort of like the flat and clip art-esque aesthetic that the generator has; however it can be a bit boring, so I think the aforementioned added details give it a nice pop.
