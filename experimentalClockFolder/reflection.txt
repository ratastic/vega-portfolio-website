  Out of the three sketches, I chose the one representing my brain acivity throughout the day as it's the most personal to me and affecting on my daily life. Creating a clock that portrays time in an unconventional manner was undeniably difficult, especially because I find myself thinking of time in a very traditional manner. But the way in which my brain works has always been helpful in tracking time-- my brain is slow in the morning and I can't think straight, while my brain at night is fast and constantly spewing thoughts.
  The canvas is split into three sections, each section portraying the time of day and my brain activity. Upon moving your mouse left to right, each section is revealed. The left section represents morning time, when my brain functions the least, the middle section represents mid-day, when the brain is semi-functioning, and the right section represents the night, when my brain is excessively loud and over-functioning. 
  I began my process by dividing the canvas into three sections, with the background color changing depending on the mouseX position: sky blue, prussian blue, and a dark navy blue to illustrate morning, afternoon, and night respectively. To make this more clear to the viewer, I added a sun, cloud, and moon and stars as well. As you change your mouse from left to right, the jitter of the brain text becomes wider and more aggressive to demonstrate increased brain activity.
