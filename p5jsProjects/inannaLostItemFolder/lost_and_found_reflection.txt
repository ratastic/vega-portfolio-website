Inanna Liaw Lost Item
  
  Inanna provided a very in depth and detailed description of their lost item in regards to the sizing, coloring, and positioning of each shape that makes up the item. I began by sketching out the object based on the description to get an idea of what I had to create. The steps were very well written and clearâ€” I wasn't once confused on what the object was supposed to be: a pocketwatch. They provided specific sizing for each shape that comprises the pocketwatch; for example, the "orange rectangle...[is] 2x as wide than tall." However, I will be honest, after sketching out the object, I took a little creative liberty with the sizing of each primitive shape. Though my re-creation of the pocketwatch does not abide by the specific size descriptions Inanna provided, I think that the essence of a pocketwatch is still there.
