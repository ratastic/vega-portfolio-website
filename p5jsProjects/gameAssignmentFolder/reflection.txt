After seeing the assignment titled as "autobiographical," I wanted to showcase a hobby of mine, something representative of
how I spend my time. So, I centered my game around foraging and
exploring. I love to collect; I have millions of shells, dried flowers and leaves, pinned bugs, and preserved animal bones. The game features five scenes in total: scene one displays an inaccurate depiction of my bedroom (I'd say my room is the opposite of boring), scene two consists of a simple stone pavement backdrop, scene three is a forest setting, scene four is a grassy field, and scene five is the beach shore; the latter three scenes are where the player can explore. Upon colliding with the tiny red squares in the latter three scenes, a pop-up of a item with a brief caption is plastered on the screen. The image that gets displayed based on which square you collide with is randomly picked from an array; each square has three possible pop-ups. I kept the scene designs simple for the sake of clarity.

Initially, I wanted to include more interactive elements such as being able to sleep in the bed, implying a day and night cycle, and a piano that plays random notes upon a mouse click. However, these goals were a bit ambitious and ultimately wouldn't have added much to the game. Additionally, I would've created every single asset, from the backdrops to the image pop-ups, in a pixel art application. The backdrops are actually found images and the pop-up items were overlayed with a pixel filter; everything else was physically drawn by me.
